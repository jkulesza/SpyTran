SPyTran
=======

Simplified 1D and 2D Sn transport for Nuclear engineering applications written mostly in python.

Supports triangular unstructured meshes generated by GMSH.

Currently uses continuous Galerkin FE technique for spatial dicretization.
Plan to move to DG methods.

Install
+++++++

Depends

    - GMSH >=2.8.5
    - Numpy >=1.10
    - Scipy
    - H5py

Optional Depends

    - matplotlib
    - pyeVTK
    - periodictable

Developer install::

    python setup.py develop


Examples
++++++++

See ``/spytran/examples`` directory for 1D and 2D example decks.
Corrosponding GMSH geometry files are in ``/spytran/examplex/geometry``.


Material Library
++++++++++++++++

A list of avalible isotopes is located ``/spytran/materials/``.  The default cross sections
are generated at 293K.

Dopper broadening must be performed by NJOY.  NJOY bash scripts are provided.  


Use
+++

1. Construct GMSH .geo file
2. Write input python script
3. Execute the python input script
4. Visualize
