\section{Results}

In all cases the group boundaries were $G = []$.
The group scalar fluxes are recovered from the angle-dependant flux by the quadrature rule ().

The first result demonstrates the discontinuous nature of the solution approximation.  Neutrons are introduce traveling from left to right with initial energy $1e10eV$.
