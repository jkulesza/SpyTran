\section{Conclusion}

A mesh convergence study could be performed in the future to experimentally determine the spatial order of convergence of the DGFE scheme.  Additionally, the results could be benchmarked against gold-standard monte-carlo simulations to ascertain the accuracy of the method, particularly when thin absorptive regions are present in the domain.

It was shown that DGFE allows for a flexible definition of the numerical flux and that this choice impacts the
